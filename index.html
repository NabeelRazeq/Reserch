  <h1>The Evolution of A.I </h1>
</header>

<h1>Concept</h1>
<div class="one">

<p>The history of the concept of Artificial intelligence dates to Mary sheller's award winning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence#History">Frankenstein</a> where the main character Dr. Frankenstein creates a living being that is capability of expressing thoughts. Sheller wrote the novel to warn sciences to not stray too far from humanity. For if a created being could express thought, would the value of intelligent life be devalued. In the year 1818, She would’ve never thought that such being could ever exist, it was mere fiction back then, a pure absurdity. But now in the year 2019, Artificial intelligent is used as a buzz word now with infinite applications. From video games to communication bots, A.I is slowly weaving its way into our society. A.I does things that our minds can’t even fathom. Even if our brains are out-processed by A.I, the A.I still can’t think on its on without even the slightest code from a human. Some speculate that this won’t be the case soon.</p>

<h1>Can you do it?</h1>
<div class="two">
  <p> IN 1950 Alan Turing , a polymath in England, wondered if thoughts can be created by inanimate object. He proposed a logical framework called <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/history-artificial-intelligence/"> Computing Machinery and Intelligence</a>. The basics of this test was that there was him creating situation that he would try to “write out” here’s an excerpt</p>
  <p id="Quote"> I propose to consider the question, "Can machines think?" This should begin with definitions of the meaning of the term's "machine" and "think." The definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude is dangerous, If the meaning of the words "machine" and "think" are to be found by examining how they are commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the meaning and the answer to the question, "Can machines think?" is to be sought in a statistical survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd. Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace the question by another, which is closely related to it and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words.-Alan Turing </p>

<h1>Dartmouth workshop</h1>
<div class="three">
  <p>In the summer of 1956, in the span of eight weeks, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_workshop">Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence</a> is considered to be the founding of what we call “Artificial intelligence”.  The man that organized it, john McCarthy, wanted to have an extended brainstorming session in order to create a foundation for this undiscovered science. He went up to many different funders like the Rockefeller foundation, Robert Morison, etc, all well known for being innovators .The way he organized it was so that his attendees would have only a portion of the total knowledge, which he would get all to himself. The attendees themselves weren’t novices, all we’ll know mathematicians. At the conferences, he discovered methods on how to make code self-making. He also was the person to coin the term artificial intelligence. At the end of the conference, he essential began progress on the new science that he discovered, with some help of course. </p>

<h1>Hey Siri</h1>
<div class="four">
<p> In the current day, we have A.I for almost everything. One A.I that almost everyone uses is Siri/google assistants. While it may appear simple, it just does what its told, It first turns your spech into prescriped words. Sounds simple, right? Well it's really hard for A.I to understand what you say since we all don't have "the normal spech pattern". Think about it , how much variations are there to the sound <a href="https://magoosh.com/data-science/siri-work-science-behind-siri/">"Hey Siri",</a> it has to acount for tone, depth , syllable, it even understanding what your even saying. Its easy for us, a developing mind with years under our belts to think about it, but how much years of information siri needs for this one interaction. Since information can be collected and passed down to each generation of phones, it gets better with each iteration of the device. It learns, but most importantly, it learns on its on, with just information backing it up.</p>

<h1>What's next?</h1>
<div class="five">
<p>The main problem with A.I now is the storage of <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2017/history-artificial-intelligence/">data</a>. Since artificial intelligence work under the premise of what to do here and adapting by it, it stores that information and then keeps it for future use. While this is really good in a hypothetical state where the worry of storage isn’t an issue, reality comes crashing down. In order for A.I to achieve the level of a human’s, we must create an computer to have almost 2.5petabytes, which is about 2500 terabytes. Another thing about the human mind is it constantly removes useless information, information that doesn’t help with the current task. In order for A.I to work, it needs to keep all the information it can get. Getting the information is also hard, since for it to runs test, it must have a lot of processing power, and most importantly ram. The way our mind works, almost all the abstract information we use is stored, unlike a computer. In order for A.I to truly be on par with humans, We still have a long way to go. </p>
